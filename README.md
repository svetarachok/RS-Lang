# RS-Lang 

'RS-Lang App' is a non commercial pet project where we tried to make a small application to learn english language (database contains 6000 words) almost fully made with vanilla typescript. 
For unregistered users application consists of text book with 6 levels and 2 mini games: AudioCall and Sprint that replicate the games from (LinguoLeo App)
Authorized users will find 7-th leve - a vocabulary where they may save words they consider to be hard, and learn them later. And there is also a statistic page to track the progress of learning words both in textbook and games.
